# Post-Quantum cryptography: When something went (totally) wrong

- Mathematical problems which are considered hard (for today)
- Problems with implementations of cryptosystems based on current problems
- Why do we need new cryptographic schemes?
- What are the particular features of these brand new postquantum schemes?
    - Underlying mathematical problems:
        - Problem of the code decoding
        - The Knapsack problem
        - The SVP
        - Finding the preimage of the hash function
- Examples of the broken postquantum schemes:
    - SIDH
    - Rainbow 
    - McEliece 
- Current status of the postquantum cryptography in the world
