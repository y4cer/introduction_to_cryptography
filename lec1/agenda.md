# Introduction + Basic Abstract algebra

- Course structure (motives, goals)

- What is cryptography (cryptography is not cryptocurrency!!)
- Brief history of cryptography
- Real life applications of cryptography: Blockchains, SSL/TLS, data storage, etc.
- Introduction to mathematical cryptography 
    - Selected topics on mathematics: abstract algebra, probability theory, number theory

// Mathematics begins, take a deep breath, we are going to take a long detour on maths
- Preliminaries
    - The set of Integers, Rationals, Reals, Complex numbers, etc.
    - Function
        - Function does not have a definition
        - $\maps$, $\mapsto$
        - Well defined function
        - Image, preimage
        - Surjection, Injection, Bijection
        - Types of functions (different types of morphisms)
    - Basic properties of integers
        - Well-ordering of integers
        - Divisibility of integers, GCD, LCM
        - Fermat's little theorem - we will prove it later on the next lecture
        - Euler's $\varphi$ function (hook to RSA cryptosystem)
- Introduction to modular arithmetics (clock arithmetics) show this monstrousity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Algebraic_structures_-_magma_to_group.svg

# HW
Build an isomorphism from $\varphi : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{N}$ and show that $\varphi$ is indeed an isomorphism, i.e. $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ are isomorphic (have the same structure)
