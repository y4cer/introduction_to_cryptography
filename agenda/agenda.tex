\section*{Introduction}
So, the time has come, I finally decided to create an introductory course on cryptography and read it during Spring 2024 
semester at Innopolis University. Approximately, course will consist of 11 lectures + corresponding homeworks.

\section*{Course prerequisites}
There are no specific course prerequisites, although it would be great if students know some mathematical analysis, 
linear algebra and set theory, as well as can read the mathematical formulas.

\section*{Course description}
This course is for those who want to become somewhat familiar with cryptography and for those who want to flex their 
brain muscles with new concepts. It is okay if you don't know much about cryptography and why is it important, at the 
end of the course you will be able to factor numbers of order $2^{1024}$ (joke) and hack some of weak implementations of
cryptographic primitives (not a joke). The course consists of 12 lectures and homeworks with practical applications to 
real life. We will also consider some real-life attacks and some silly ones, from CTFs. 

\section*{Course outcomes}
The student is expected to become familiar with basic algebraic notations and definitions, as types of morphisms, 
semigroups, monoids, groups and rings, as well as obtain some practical experience with cryptanalysis and applied 
cryptography. 

\section*{Course books}
\begin{itemize}
    \item `An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography', Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher, Joseph H. Silverman
    \item `Modern Cryptanalysis techniques', Christopher Swanson
    \item `Algebra', Serge Lang
\end{itemize}
